Aquarium application

Developed in Python, using Turtle graphics

After start, program shows empty aquarium. Right mouse click adds a fish into aquarium. 
It swims random direction, randomly turns once in a time. Fish has a indicator of life - it is a long line above the fish. 
When you do not feed it, the line is still shorter and shorter and when it is too short, the fish dies (disappear from aquarium).

You can feed fish with left mouse click or left mouse motion. Food moves slowly down to the bottom of aquarium, 
and when fish spots it, it turns towards food and eats it. Line above fish grows acoording to amount of food it eats. 
When the food is not eatten by fish, it disappears on the bottom of aquarium.
