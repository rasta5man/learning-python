Book finder APP.

This program helps to find books from database, according to entered criteria from user.

Database file "bestsellers_list.txt" contains a list of more than 1000 bestsellers to demonstrate the example of use.
After start, the program displays a menu of options and allows the user to search for books by certain criteria. The menu items are:

-   Extract all books from any years range: Prompts for two years (start and end year), then lists all books that are listed between those two years (inclusive).
    For example, if a user enters "1970" and "1973", all books that were bestsellers in 1970, 1971, 1972, or 1973 are displayed.
-   List all books from a particular month and year: You'll be prompted for the month and year, then list all the books that were best sellers during that month.
    For example, if a user enters "7" and "1985", all books that were bestsellers during the month of July in 1985 would be displayed.
-   Search for books by an author: You'll be prompted to enter a string, then list all books whose author contains that string (regardless of case).
    For example, if the user enters "ST", all books whose author name contains "ST", "St", "sT" or "st" are listed.
-   Title search: You are prompted for a string, then it lists all books whose title contains that string (regardless of the case).
    For example, if the user enters "secret", there are three books: "The Secret of Santa Vittoria" by Robert Crichton, "The Secret Pilgrim" by John le CarrÃ© and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets".
